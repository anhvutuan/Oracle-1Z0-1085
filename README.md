## Comprehensive cheat sheet to pass Oracle 1Z0-1085 Exam

------

### **Short Notes**

- Region : Each Availability Domain has three Fault Domains
- Compute instance always get a private IP address.
- Network bandwidth is proportional to the number of OCPUs in the Instance shape
- Compartments can be nested.
- You can launch either virtual machines or bare metal instances.

### **Single Choice Answer**

------

<u>**Basic Concept:**</u>

- Key benefit of using OCI --> Committed performance with predictable pricing model
- You manage in an IaaS Offering --> Operating System
- Horizontal scaling --> Adding additional compute instance
- Vertical Scaling --> Adding more CPU or memory to an existing server
- Scaling in OCI --> Scaling up or down, and scaling in or out.
- Logically group and isolate OCI resources --> Compartments
- Categorize multiple users into teams --> Groups
- Leverages Terraform to configure infrastructure as a code --> Resource Manager
- Protect against unexpected hardware or power supply failures within an availability domain --> Fault Domain.
- Protect against power failures within an availability Domain --> Fault Domain
- Mission critical application requires to be globally available at all time --> Use multiple fault domains in each availability domain in each region.





**<u>Storage:</u>**

- key benefit of OCI Virtual Machine DB Systems --> Support for RACDB systems/Fast provisioning/ Scaleup Block Storage Anytime. 
- Immediate retrieval storage --> Object storage (Standard)
- Lowest pricing for storage --> OCI Archive Storage
- Provide a shared file system across multiple compute instance --> File Storage
- Migrate old database backups from on-premises data centre to OCI --> Archive Storage





**<u>Database:</u>**

- NOT available as part of OCI Free Tier --> OCI Exadata DB System
- OCI Managed database offer managed Real Application Cluster (RAC) --> VM DB System
- Benefit of ADW --> Scale both CPU and Storage without downtime
- Provides the best performance for running OTLP workloads --> ATP



**<u>Networking:</u>**

- Edge Service in OCI --> Web Application Firewall.
- Establish a secure connection between an on premise data centre and OCI --> IPSec VPN
- OCI service can you use to assess user security of your Oracle databases --> Oracle Data Safe
- Dynamic Routing Gateway Serve --> Enables OCI Compute instance to connect to on-premises environment.
- NOT part of OCI always free eligible resources --> Fast Connect (1 *** public peering)
- Dedicated connection with minimal network latency from on-premises data centre to OCI --> OCI Fast-Connect





**<u>Support & Maintenance:</u>**

- Cannot be used with My Oracle Support(MOS) --> Solve an issue in Always Free resources in an OCI Free Trial Account.
- NOT required to register and log support request in My Oracle Support --> Your Account Password
- OCI resources can be used to group/categorize expenses -->  Tags and compartments
- NOT a default feature of Cost Analysis --> Filter Cost by Application
- Pricing method not supported by OCI --> Reserved Instance
- SLA type NOT offered by OCI Compute service --> Application Plane
- NOT available to you whenever OCI creates or resolves an incident --> Twitter Notification
- Frequency of OCI Usage Report generation --> Daily
- Moving large amounts of data from your on-premises to OCI --> Data Transfer Appliance
- Send you an alert when you might exceed your spending threshold --> Budgets
- Not covered by OCI SLA --> Reliability

1. Pricing is low an predictable across all regions and services
2. Performance claims with Service level agreement

**OCI Budget can be set on**

1. Cost-Tracking Tags
2. Compartments

**Components part of OCI IAM service**

1. Policies
2. Users
3. Dynamic Groups

**Two security capabilities are offered by OCI**

1. Always On Data Encryption for data at rest
2. Key Management Service
